# PUI 2017 HW8


### Creating a plot

For this assignment, I created a plot showing the temperature anomaly in New York City from 1895 until today. The temperature anomaly is defined as the distance of the year's temperature value from the overall period mean. The plot shows us that in the more recent years temperatures have been more likely than not higher than average.  

The data is obtained from the NOAA (National Centers for Environmental Information) website, at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/.


See notebook in this repository for the code used to create this plot.
