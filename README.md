PUI2017_bb1569

To set up local environment:
Create an export path that links to my directory **PUI2017_bb1569**. Save this path in my bash_profile. Then I created an alias called pui2017 and saved it in the bash_profile. The alias' function is to set the directory to PUI2017_bb1569, so that if I type pui2017 on the terminal the cd is directly set to that folder.

We also created a repo on github with the same name. The repo is equivalent to the directory in my local machine, so when I make changes on my local machine (like now) I can later push them to github, and if I make changes to github I can pull them on my local machine.
