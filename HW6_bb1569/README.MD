*Team Composition* : Michael Sampson, Gokmen Dedemen and Bianca Brusco 

### Assignment 1

I started this assignmnet with the import of the data, merging datasets and the exploratory analysis. I then created the three regression models 
and compared them through Chi-Sq test and Log-Likelihood test. 
Gokmen reviewed and improved my code -- he also did all the plots and the lines of best fit.
Michael reviewed and checked our code.
