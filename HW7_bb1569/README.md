Link to Authorea article https://www.authorea.com/210296/dEZK-KMGYs-LtOOJ-dmepA.
The article is also in this repository, but cannot be opened via github because it is too large. 

The notebook with the project is both attached here and to the Authorea article. 
This mini project was developed with Gokmen and Michael, and I incorporated the reviews suggested by ssb602. 

## Assignment 2 : SQL Lab

I completed this assignment individually, by getting the SQL code we run in class with Prof. Vo. The queries are in the SQLLab jupyter notebook.  
**Extra credit** I modified the code provided by Prof. Bianco as to make it Python 2 and 3 , and run the code on both kernels.
