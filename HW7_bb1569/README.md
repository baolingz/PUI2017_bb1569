The notebook with the project is both attached here and to the Authorea article. 
This mini project was developed with Gokmen and Michael. We all contributed to the Authorea article and we incorporated the reviews suggested by ssb602, and sac820. 

## Assignment 2 : SQL Lab

I completed this assignment individually, by getting the SQL code we run in class with Prof. Vo. The queries are in the SQLLab jupyter notebook.  
**Extra credit** I modified the code provided by Prof. Bianco as to make it Python 2 and 3 , and run the code on both kernels.
