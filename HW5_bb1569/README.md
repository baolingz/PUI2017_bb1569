*Team Composition* : Michael Sampson, Gokmen Dedemen and Bianca Brusco 


### Assignment 1

In this assignment, we explore the distribution of the Z statistic. 
I completed this part of the assignment and reviewed with the team. 

### Assignment 2

This assignment aims at answering the question "how do a binomial and poisson approximate to a normal as we increase n and lambda?"
I completed this part of the assignment and reviewed with the team. 

### Assignment 3


In this assignment we investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP.

I imported and merged data. Gokmen did most of the plotting. He created the best line fit and did the OLS and WLS regression. 
Michael, Gokmen and I reviewed the regressions (especially WLS), reviewed and completed the last parts of the assignment.
