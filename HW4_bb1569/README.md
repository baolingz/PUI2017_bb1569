*Team Composition** : Michael Sampson and Bianca Brusco 

### Question 1

I reviewed iy310 Citibike "experiment" and submitted a pull request to her/his repo. 

### Question 2 

Michael mainly worked on this, and we reviewed together. 

### Question 3

Michael worked on this question, and we reviewed together.

### Question 4

I mainly worked on this question -- for the Day/Night part. We worked together on finding boroughs.
I decided to use Geopy after some googling and reading documentation. 

The method we had devised to import the bourough data seemed to work on a small dataset -- however on both of our machines we would get runtime errors. We wrote the notebook with the code as we have run it from small subset and replaced with variable of full dataset. Theoretically it should work but we can't run it!
