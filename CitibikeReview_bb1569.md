The hypothesis suggested here wants to test for ratio of subscribers and customers with respect to their 
trip duration

Verifications

a. Hypothesis formulation: 
 Null and alternate hypothesis are formulated correctly
 
 Suggestion: Using a formula would have helped in understanding better as the statement is too lengthy.
 
b. Data for project:

 Data used supports the project, as it has user type and trip duration which are required to verify the hypothesis.

C. Test Suggestion
Test Suggested: z-test

Refering to the chart of tests by type of question, since the hypothesis aims to see whether data comes from 
different or same populations. This can be said since the hypothesis is based on ratio of two populations.

With reference to an online source(https://explorable.com/z-test), z-test is used for for difference of proportions
is used to test the hypothesis that two populations have the same proportion. This is exactly what the hypothesis
here is doing.
